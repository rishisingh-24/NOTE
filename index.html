            <h1>!!NOTE FOR MY LOVELY PANDAüëª‚ù§Ô∏è!!</h1>
            <p>Panda, mujhe pta hai aisa Mummy, Oscar and apne pyaare se ghar ko phir se chorna, to prepare for your banking exam is going to be tough, and even though papa bhi aaj aye honge to sb axa axa lg rha hoga. It's not easy to be away from the people you love, especially when you're used to having them around all the time for the past 1.5 months. But I want you to know that I'm here for you, and I'll be with you every step of the way.<br><br>
                Panda yrr mai feel to nhi kr skta hu how you are feeling right now, but I can imagine how hard it must be for you to say goodbye to everyone. But I want you to remember that you're doing this for a reason. You're chasing your dreams, and jiske liye bahut hi himmat chahiye. Aur sbse important baat btao isme kya hai ki tumne kisi ka dekha dekhi nhi kr rhi ho, you are making your own decision which is very precious, I'm so proud of you Panda for taking this step, even when it's hard.<br><br>
                Ha ye baat to hai ki ye ane wala time tumhare liye bahut hi difficult hone wala hai, but I believe in you. I know that you've got this. You've worked hard to get to where you are, tum padhayi ke saath saath job bhi kiya krti thi, and I would say it‚Äôs not an easy job and you can do it again. Apne undr koi bhi doubt aur dr mt ane do khaas kr is time jb tumhe strong khda hona hai aur bahar jana hai akele. You're capable of achieving anything you set in your mind, and I'll be right here cheering you on<br><br>
                Aur ha jb bhi tumhe akelapn lge, depressed ho tum, to uss cheez ko apne upr burden mt bnne do, ¬†just remember why you started. And know that I'm here, I can‚Äôt hold your hand physically, but virtually I will be always there for you holding your hand through it all. You're not alone, my Panda. Tumhare peeche sb log hai mummy, papa, bhai aur ha oscar ko mt bhulna aur khi na khi sbke baad me mai bhi hu, who loves you, and who will support you no matter what.<br><br>
                I know aage aisa din ayega ki you'll feel like giving up, jb tumpe pressure aur stree bahut jyada hoga. But don't let that happen. Hold on to your yourself, hold on to your believes, and hold on to me. I'll be right here, holding on to you, every step of the way.<br><br>
                Ek baat bol rha hu Panda tum bs ye nhi ki exam ki preparation krne ja rhi ho, tum apni life bnane ja rhi ho. You're creating a future that's full of hope. Aur ha hme khush hai ki hm tumhare uss life ka part jha tum apne life ke sbse hard days se figh krogi<br><br>
                To ab poora full confidence se jao jaise iss background video me ho tum aur jo jo tumhe underestimate krte hai unhe btao ki hm kya hai. Make them all prove wrong, ki phir kbhi wo log tumpe ungli na utha paye. And make them regret what they had lost in their life by loosing your trust. And whenever you need someone to trust on, or to have a conversation on, or to share your thoughts whether it is a good one or bad one, or you are upset feeling low. I'll be right here, waiting for you.</p><br>
